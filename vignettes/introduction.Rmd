The purpose of the package is to enable R users to use MarkLogic without deep knowledge of JavaScript/XQuery or the REST API. It goes beyond ODBC and expose a lot of the functionality within MarkLogic.

It is using MarkLogic server built in [REST API](http://docs.marklogic.com/REST) with the use of [REST extensions](http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/rest-dev/extensions). 

Currently rfml is using the following extensions:

* rfml.dframe - handles the definition and data of a ml.data.frame object. 

* rfml.stat - for execution of statistics functions

* rfml.lm - for execution of a simple regression 

* rfml.matrix - for matrix type of functions such as summary and correlation matrix

* rfml.arules - for doing association mining

In addition, there is two libraries installed:

* rfmlUtilities - helper functions

* xml2json - functions to convert XML to JSON, based on https://github.com/abdmob/x2js

All backend code is developed in JavaScript. Depending on MarkLogic server version either [jsearch](http://docs.marklogic.com/js/jsearch) or [cts search](http://docs.marklogic.com/js/cts/search) functions are used. The code is also trying to use existing Range indexes if possible, currently only element range indexes are supported.

The package is designed to utilize the MarkLogic server as much as possible by pushing processing back to the database and only keeping information about the data on the client.

## Data handling
Most data within MarkLogic server are either stored as XML or JSON which is very flexible data formats enabling a hierarchy structure. However, this type of storage is not always optimal for the analysis done with R, most analytical functions expect a tabular format.

Rfml is overcoming that obstacle by converting data retrieved from MarkLogic Server  into a tabular format, it can handle both XML and JSON documents.

As a  example consider the following XML document:
```XML
<customerOrder>
  <orderNumber>T200<orderNumber>
  <lineItems>
    <lineItem>
      <orderLineNumber>1</orderLineNumber>
      <productNo>2</productNo>
      <productName>1900s Vintage Bi-Plane</productName>
      <quantityOrdered>21</quantityOrdered>
      <priceEach>33.00</priceEach>
      <lineTotal>693</lineTotal>
    </lineItem>
    <lineItem>
      <orderLineNumber>2</orderLineNumber>
      <productNo>4</productNo>
      <productName>Collectable Wooden Train</productName>
      <quantityOrdered>32</quantityOrdered>
      <priceEach>23.45</priceEach>
      <lineTotal>750.4</lineTotal>
    </lineItem>
  </lineItems>
</customerOrder>
```
When viewed using rfml it will look like this:
```
customerOrder1orderNumber lineItem1orderLineNumber lineItem1productNo   lineItem1productName   lineItem1quantityOrdered lineItem1priceEach lineItem1lineTotal lineItem2orderLineNumber lineItem2productNo     lineItem2productName lineItem2quantityOrdered lineItem2priceEach lineItem2lineTotal
                    T200                        1                  2    1900s Vintage Bi-Plane                       21                 33                693                        2                  4 Collectable Wooden Train                       32              23.45              750.4


```
What is happening behind the scene is that all data is flatten out before returned to the R client. Column names are created based on the level the element is, having the names of the parent elements with a number after before the element name.

```XML
<customerOrder><orderNumber>
```
becomes
```
customerOrder1orderNumber
```
This means that values that are in the same level with the same element name will be in the same column in the result. 

Another effect is that there is a risk of getting very wide tables, so a best practise is to keep your documents in MarkLogic server simple if they are going to be used with rfml.

## Setting up a MarkLogic databse to be used with rfml
Before you can use rfml against a MarkLogic Server database you need to make sure that there are a [HTTP/REST server](http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/admin/http) , with a [modules database](http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/admin/databases#id_38484) , defined.

You also need to install the REST extensions and library modules; this is needed once for each database that is going to be used with the package.  In order to that you need to use an administrator user or a user with rest-admin role or the following privileges:

* rest-admin

* rest-writer

* rest-reader

The actual installation is done with the ml.init.database function, as in the example below.
```R
library(rfml)
# setup the database to be used with rfml
ml.init.database("localhost", "8088", "admin", "admin")
````
Once the function is done you can start using rfml.

## Using rfml
Before data can be selected a call to ml.connect is needed, the function verifies that the database is setup correctly and returns a connection object. You can have multiple connections at the same time.
```R
#create a connection
localConn <- ml.connect("localhost","8000", "myuser", "mypassword")
```
After the connections is done there is multiple ways to select data from the MarkLogic database.

Using a string query, more information around the syntax can be found at http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/search-dev/search-api#id_41745, to search within a collection.
```R
# create a ml.data.frame
mlIris <- ml.data.frame(localConn, "setosa", collection = "iris")
```
It is also possible to do field level filtering. When using it there a re different requriments depending on the operator used. For ">"  "<"  "!=" "<=" ">=" operators a Element Range Index are needed on the field used, index can be created using the ml.add.index function. "==" can be used without Element Range Indexes.
```R
# create a ml.data.frame object based filtering on the Species field
mlIris <- ml.data.frame(localConn, fieldFilter = "Species == setosa")
# create a ml.data.frame object based filtering on the Petal.Length field, this requires a Element Range Index
mlIris <- ml.data.frame(localConn, fieldFilter = "Petal.Length > 5")
``
There is also possible to upload data to the MarkLogic database, which returns a ml.data.frame object.
```R
# create a ml.data.frame object based on the iris data set
mlIris <- as.ml.data.frame(localConn, iris, "iris")
```
No data is pulled back to the client, if not asked for using for example head.
```R
# pull back the first 6 rows, the returned object is a data.frame
head(mlIris)
#    Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length       Petal.Width     Species
# 1  6.4              2.9               4.3              1.3            versicolor
# 2  5.6              2.9               3.6              1.3            versicolor
# 3  6.4              2.8               5.6              2.1            virginica
# 4  6.1              2.6               5.6              1.4            virginica
# 5  5.6              3.0               4.5              1.5            versicolor
# 6  4.7              3.2               1.6              0.2            setosa
```
It is possible to create new columns for the ml.data.frame object. The columns only exist within the object and are not physical created in the source documents in the database. 
```R
# create a field based on an existing
mlIris$newField <- mlIris$Petal.Width

# create a field based calculation on existing
mlIris$newField2 <- mlIris$Petal.Width + mlIris$Petal.Length

# create a field based on a previous created
mlIris$newField3 <- mlIris$Petal.Width + 10

mlIris$abs_width <- abs(mlIris$Petal.Width)
```
The new columns are calculated at runtime when retrieving the data, the calculation is done on the server side.
```R
# pull back the whole result, including the previous created fields
head(mlIris)
#    Sepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species     newField newField2 newField3 abs_width
# 1  6.4           2.9          4.3         1.3         versicolor  1.3       5.6      11.3       1.3
# 2  5.6           2.9          3.6         1.3         versicolor  1.3       4.9      11.3       1.3
# 3  6.4           2.8          5.6         2.1         virginica   2.1       7.7      12.1       2.1
# 4  6.1           2.6          5.6         1.4         virginica   1.4       7.0      11.4       1.4
# 5  5.6           3.0          4.5         1.5         versicolor  1.5       6.0      11.5       1.5
# 6  4.7           3.2          1.6         0.2         setosa      0.2       1.8      10.2       0.2
```
You can also extract a selection from a ml.data.frame into a new ml.data.frame. 

For example, the following statement would select only rows where the column 'Species' equals 'setosa', and only the columns 'Sepal.Length' and 'Sepal.Width'
```R
mlIris2 <- mlIris[mlIris$Species=="setosa",c("Sepal.Length","Sepal.Width")]
```
If the data is going to be used with functions not covered with the rfml package or with other package, it can be pulled back and returned as a data.frame object.

```R
localDf <- as.data.frame(mlIris)
```
