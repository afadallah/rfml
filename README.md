# rfml â€“ a R package for MarkLogic Server

rfml is a R package for MarkLogic Server, Enterprise NoSQL database, enabling in-dabase analytics.

It is based on the REST interface to allow users to use search syntax for creating a data.frame similar object, ml.data.frame. There is no data brought back to the client during the creation of the object. [More information on the wiki](https://github.com/mstellwa/rfml/wiki/Introduction-to-the-rfml-package)

rfml only works with MarkLogic Server version 8 and higher.

In order to use rfml you need a REST server, with a module database, for the MarkLogic database that contains your source data..

**If you have previous installed rfml, before 7th December 2015, you need to execute ml.clear.database before installing the new version.**

Currently the package is not avalible on CRAN so you need to install it using devtools.
```R
if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("mstellwa/rfml")
```

After the package is installed you need to setup the database that is to be used. You need to use a administrator user or a user with rest-admin role or the following privileges; http://marklogic.com/xdmp/privileges/rest-admin, http://marklogic.com/xdmp/privileges/rest-writer, http://marklogic.com/xdmp/privileges/rest-reader.

```R
library(rfml)
# setup the database to be used with rfml, will install query options and transformation
ml.init.database("localhost", "8000", "admin", "admin")

````
After the setup you can use a standard user with http://marklogic.com/xdmp/privileges/rest-reader and if you want to upload data http://marklogic.com/xdmp/privileges/rest-writer priviligies.

Before data can be selected a call to ml.connect is needed, the function verifies that the database is setup correctly and also saves the connection information.
```R
#create a connection
ml.connect("localhost","8000", "myuser", "mypassword")
```
After the connections is done there is multiple ways to select data from the MarkLogic database.

Using a string query, more information around the syntax can be found at http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/search-dev/search-api#id_41745, to search within a collection.
```R
# create a ml.data.frame
mlIris <- ml.data.frame("setosa", collection = "iris")
```
It is also possible to do simple field level filtering, only == is currently supported.
```R
# create a ml.data.frame object based filtering on the Species field
mlIris <- ml.data.frame(fieldFilter = "Species == setosa")
```
There is also possible to upload data to the MarkLogic database, which returns a ml.data.frame object.
```R
# create a ml.data.frame object based on the iris data set
mlIris <- as.ml.data.frame(iris, "iris")
```
No data is pulled back to the client, if not asked for using for example head.
```R
# pull back the first 6 rows, the returned object is a data.frame
head(mlIris)
#    Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length       Petal.Width     Species
# 1  6.4              2.9               4.3              1.3            versicolor
# 2  5.6              2.9               3.6              1.3            versicolor
# 3  6.4              2.8               5.6              2.1            virginica
# 4  6.1              2.6               5.6              1.4            virginica
# 5  5.6              3.0               4.5              1.5            versicolor
# 6  4.7              3.2               1.6              0.2            setosa
```
It is possible to create new columns for the ml.data.frame object. The columns only exists within the object and are not created at the database. 
```R
# create a field based on an existing
mlIris$newField <- mlIris$Petal.Width

# create a field based calculation on existing
mlIris$newField2 <- mlIris$Petal.Width + mlIris$Petal.Length

# create a field based on an previous created
mlIris$newField3 <- mlIris$Petal.Width + 10

mlIris$abs_width <- abs(mlIris$Petal.Width)
```
The new columns are calculated at runtime when retriving the data, the calculation is done on the server side.
```R
# pull back the whole result, including the previous created fields
head(mlIris)
#    Sepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species     newField newField2 newField3 abs_width
# 1  6.4           2.9          4.3         1.3         versicolor  1.3       5.6      11.3       1.3
# 2  5.6           2.9          3.6         1.3         versicolor  1.3       4.9      11.3       1.3
# 3  6.4           2.8          5.6         2.1         virginica   2.1       7.7      12.1       2.1
# 4  6.1           2.6          5.6         1.4         virginica   1.4       7.0      11.4       1.4
# 5  5.6           3.0          4.5         1.5         versicolor  1.5       6.0      11.5       1.5
# 6  4.7           3.2          1.6         0.2         setosa      0.2       1.8      10.2       0.2
```
You can also extract a selection from a ml.data.frame into a new ml.data.frame. For example, the
following statements, would select only rows for which the column 'Species' equals 'setosa', and
only the columns 'Sepal.Length' and 'Sepal.Width'
```R
mlIris2 <- mlIris[mlIris$Species=="setosa",c("Sepal.Length","Sepal.Width")]
```
It is possible also to pull back data from a  ml.data.frame object, it is returned as a data.frame.
```R
localDf <- as.data.frame(mlIris)
```
